# swipe-see

IATA Hackathon 2019 - Seattle

This is an app that allows you to plan your events well before your vacation, but the twist is that it "gamifies" the events. You will "swipe" left and right, similar to Tinder, for the events you find interesting. The events are provided by Expedia's APIs that were provided exclusive for the IATA hackathon. Unfortunately the API key's have since expired, but you can [view a demo of this app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIpdsyKGrUg).
